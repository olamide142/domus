* Some notes for you...

1. Start the server first, then the DB.
   1. Everything else can be started in any order
2. The inspector is not part of the system, but there to help you
   1. Use one of: make run_db, make run_server, make run_heating, make run_interface
   2. You will then have a prompt on a machine sharing a network interface with the target
   3. Use whatever tools you need to investigate
   4. I left a couple of things to help inside the bash history, so
      you might try pressing the up arrow...
